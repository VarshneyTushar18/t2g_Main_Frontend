                <p>
                  Selling products on Walmart Marketplace gives your business an opportunity to reach
                  customers who are actively shopping for everyday essentials, electronics, home
                  products, beauty items, and more. However, simply listing your products does not
                  guarantee visibility or consistent sales. With multiple sellers competing for
                  customer attention, your products need the right advertising strategy to stand out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A professional Walmart Advertising Agency can help you plan, launch, and optimize
                  advertising campaigns based on your business goals. Whether you are launching a new
                  product, trying to increase sales of existing products, or improving advertising
                  profitability, the right strategy can help you make better use of your advertising
                  budget.

                <p>
                  Walmart advertising services involve planning, managing, and optimizing paid
                  campaigns to promote products on Walmart&apos;s digital marketplace. These services
                  help businesses connect with relevant shoppers, improve product discovery, and
                  measure the performance of their advertising investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are managing your Walmart store independently, handling advertising alongside
                  inventory, pricing, product listings, and customer requirements can become
                  challenging. An experienced advertising partner can help organize these activities
                  and identify opportunities for improvement.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  Depending on your business needs, Walmart advertising management may include:

                <p className="mb-0">
                  The objective is not simply to spend more on advertisements. It is to understand

                  goals.

                  Why Does Your Business Need a Walmart Advertising Agency?

                  If your products are receiving impressions but generating few sales, or your
                  advertising costs are increasing without a corresponding improvement in revenue, you
                  may need a more structured campaign strategy. A Walmart advertising agency can help
                  address common challenges such as poor product visibility, irrelevant clicks,
                  inefficient bidding, and limited campaign insights.

                <p>
                  Your Walmart advertising budget depends on your product category, competition,

                </div>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  Start with a budget that your business can support, monitor results, and scale
                  carefully when the data justifies additional investment.

                <p className="mb-0">
                  A sustainable advertising strategy should consider total business profitability
                  rather than judging success by advertising revenue alone.

                  How Do You Measure Walmart Advertising Performance?
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Understanding the right metrics helps you evaluate whether your campaigns are moving
                  toward your goals.
                </p>
                <div className="row">
                  {metrics.map((item) => (
                    <div key={item.title} className="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 mb-3">
                      <div className="card p-3 h-100 shadow-sm">
                        <h5>{item.title}</h5>

                    </div>
                  ))}
                </div>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  For example, if you spend $500 on advertising and generate $2,000 in attributed
                  advertising sales, your ROAS is 4x and your ACOS is 25%.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-0">
                  However, these metrics should be interpreted together. A campaign with a strong ROAS
                  may still be unprofitable if product margins are low or other business costs are
                  high. Attribution windows and reporting definitions should also be considered when
                  evaluating results.
