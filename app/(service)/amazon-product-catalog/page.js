                                    Amazon catalog management is the process of creating, organizing, maintaining, and updating the product information associated with a brand&apos;s Amazon listings.

                                    A product catalog can include information such as product titles, descriptions, images, specifications, variations, categories, attributes, identifiers, and other listing data.

                                    For a business with a handful of products, managing this information may be relatively simple. But when a catalog contains hundreds or thousands of SKUs, keeping everything accurate becomes a continuous operational task.
