                                    Data extraction services involve collecting relevant information from different sources and converting it into a structured format that businesses can use for analysis, research, operations, or decision making.

                                    Data can be extracted from websites, documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, images, scanned records, online marketplaces, social platforms, and other permitted sources.

                                    For example, an ecommerce business may need product names, prices, specifications, ratings, and availability from multiple websites.

A business may also need information from thousands of documents converted into a structured database.
