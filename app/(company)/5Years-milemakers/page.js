One thing that I have explored with these experiences is my enthusiasm to jump into multiple activities in the office. Being from a technical background, I started as a software developer, but here at Tech2Globe, I am more into managing people, and this eventually became my forte. During Covid, we were able to manage the company and all the employees as a whole with no layoffs or salary deductions.",

During Covid, we were able to manage the company and all the employees as a whole with no layoffs or salary deductions. This was something we have learnt throughout our journey, that is, prioritising our people over anything. We started with a team of 5, which has now been expanded to 250+ people strength, and this is not going to stop here, same as our enthusiasm from the very first day. I am glad to be a part of a team who are supportive, stand for each other in all situations, and work towards a common objective."
